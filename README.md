# LEZ Atomic Swap Suite

Trustless swaps between Logos Execution Zone (LEZ) and Bitcoin, Monero, and
Zcash's transparent pool.

The accepted delivery scope is Gateway's replacement proposal
[logos-co/rfp#112](https://github.com/logos-co/rfp/issues/112), interpreted
together with the live
[RFP-003](https://github.com/logos-co/rfp/blob/master/RFPs/RFP-003-atomic-swaps.md).
The earlier issue #61 is superseded and Ethereum is not an in-scope pair.

## Current status

Development has started with protocol and real-node acceptance tests. The
current executable slices enforce:

- the taker-funded lock is confirmed before the maker can lock the second leg;
- claim completion after the first lock needs only on-chain evidence; and
- pair-specific claim and recovery ordering, including LEZ-before-ZEC claim and
  refund in both ZEC trade directions;
- immutable local/public-testnet ZEC profiles with network/branch binding,
  checked deadlines, required calibration, and exact margin enforcement;
- typed ZEC observations that re-decode canonical transaction bytes and bind
  network, branch, block, outpoint, value, exact BIP-199 scripts, and depth
  before projecting evidence into the chain-independent coordinator, populated
  from stable actual Zebra RPC queries in the actor E2E;
- exact BIP-199 P2SH plus canonical Zcash V5 funding, claim, and refund
  transactions; and
- actor-keyed funding/claim/refund acceptance and rejection through pinned
  Zebra NU6.2 Regtest consensus, including a two-node conflicting
  four-over-three-block canonical fork replacement; and
- checked-guest deployment plus real-key native LEZ initialize/fund/claim and
  permissionless-refund execution in an isolated standalone sequencer; and
- two-definition official-ATA claim/refund lifecycles with real owner keys,
  immutable destinations, and cross-definition substitution rejection; and
- machine-checked recursive native/authenticated-transfer and token/ATA/Token
  Risc0 session costs with setup and Clock noise excluded.

## Development

Prerequisites: Rust 1.96.0. Docker is needed for the isolated Zebra consensus
suite and the pinned Risc0 guest builder; Docker Compose v2 is used by Zebra.
The [manual reproduction guide](docs/manual-user-flows.md) lists the complete
per-run prerequisites, isolation rules, commands, expected evidence, and
cleanup behavior.

### External dependencies and flakiness

The current operator, Zebra, and LEZ flows use no public blockchain RPC or
faucet. Maker and Zebra host endpoints are ephemeral loopback services. The LEZ
test client uses loopback, but pinned upstream v0.1.2 binds its ephemeral server
to the host wildcard address; it is short-lived and collision-isolated, not
loopback/network-namespace isolated. Test funds are
deterministic local genesis/Regtest outputs. Cold builds still depend on
rustup/crates.io, locked GitHub sources, digest-pinned Docker Hub/GCR images,
the checksum-pinned Logos circuits release, and `rzup`'s pinned Risc0 tools.
Availability, DNS, proxy, registry throttling, or GitHub/CDN outages can block
an uncached run, but cannot relax the lockfile, digest, checksum, ELF, ImageID,
or consensus checks. Warm verified caches reduce this availability risk.

These are real local on-chain executions, not mocks: pinned Zebra
validates/mempools/mines signed Zcash
transactions and chooses a higher-work fork; the pinned LEZ sequencer deploys
the checked guest, executes production state transitions, and persists
canonical actor/custody state. Loopback supplies safe isolation while the real
consensus/state-transition implementations supply fidelity. Regtest/standalone
do not prove public peer
propagation, fee markets, organic timing/reorg behavior, provider quirks, or LEZ
testnet 0.2 compatibility. A composed local corridor and self-hosted/public
testnet corridor with real funded accounts remain mandatory M2 evidence.

CI also refreshes RustSec and Trivy vulnerability data. A database outage may
block scanning; a newly published advisory may deliberately turn a prior pass
red. Do not bypass that failure as “flaky.” Public-testnet RPCs/faucets have not
yet been selected; their provider limits, health checks, fallback/self-hosted
routes, and funding assumptions are an explicit M2 documentation gate. See the
[full resource/flakiness table](docs/manual-user-flows.md#external-resources-and-flakiness).

The Zebra suite uses a unique `lez-atomic-swaps-${RUN_ID}` Compose project. It
copies the binary from the digest-pinned official Zebra 5.2.0 image into a
digest-pinned distroless nonroot runtime, then runs two disconnected nodes on a
project-only network with read-only filesystems, independent tmpfs state,
resource caps, no Linux capabilities, and separate ephemeral localhost RPC
ports. Before Compose starts it allocates an absolute run-scoped maker SQLite
database and refuses any pre-existing manifest, database, WAL, or SHM. The suite
first proves real canonical funding, close/reopen/requery, deeper-fork removal,
second restart, and exact replay through the maker runtime; it then runs the
actor fund/claim/refund/concurrent-fork consensus fixture. Cleanup addresses that
exact project and never prunes or stops resources it did not create.
